Course assignments for SNHU CS 230

* **Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?** <br>
THe client wanted a web-based application of their game Draw It or Lose It and it needed to work on multiple platforms. My software design document contains comparisons, considerations, and recommendations for three different platforms; Windows, MacOS, and Linux.<br><br>
* **What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?** <br>
I think I did well with my chart of development requirements.<br><br>
* **What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?** <br>
It was helpful to have a template with which to organize the different design components.<br><br>
* **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?** <br>
I would have liked to expand my recommendation section further. Unfortunately, I was just having too many health problems this term so I had to be satisfied with good enough.<br><br>
* **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?** <br>
I paid attention to the requirements listed in the course information. It's important to consider the user because that's who all the work is ultimately for. If the final product doesn't meet expetations, people won't want to use it.<br><br>
* **How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?** <br>
I made sure that my code was readable and had clear comments that explained exactly what each section of code was meant to accomplish.
